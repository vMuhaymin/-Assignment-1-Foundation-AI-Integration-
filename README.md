## 1) Tools Used & Use Cases

- **AI assistant (ChatGPT)**
  - Suggested and helped in writing `script.js` to improve interactivity:
    - Active navigation highlight on scroll.
    - Click-to-zoom modal for project images.
    - “Message sent” toast for the contact form (no backend needed).
  - Debug guidance and explanations for HTML/CSS layout issues (e.g., centering, spacing, stacking contexts).
  - Copy editing and structure suggestions for the portfolio sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact).

- **Web browsing for inspiration**
  - Reviewed multiple web-based portfolio designs to gather layout ideas

## 2) Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
- **Concepts became more stable:** AI explanations helped reinforce core front-end concepts (layout flow, spacing, alignment).
- **CSS management improved:** Better handling of margins/padding, hover effects, and consistent color/typography tokens.
- **Faster iteration:** Quick drafts for text and JS features reduced time spent on boilerplate.

### Challenges
- **Centering elements:** Initially struggled with vertical/horizontal centering across sections; resolved with flexbox and consistent containers.
- **Locating errors:** When something broke, it wasn’t always clear whether the issue was in HTML structure, CSS specificity, or missing assets.
- **Scope control:** Avoiding over-engineering (keeping features lightweight and aligned with a simple portfolio).

## 3) Learning Outcomes

- **Layout mastery:** Practiced reliable centering and spacing using Flexbox and predictable containers
- **Interactive UI basics:** Implemented small JS enhancements (active link, modal, toast) without heavy libraries.
- **Debugging workflow:** Adopted a methodical approach:
  1. Reproduce and isolate the issue.
  2. Toggle CSS rules to find specificity or layout conflicts.
  3. Apply minimal, targeted fixes.

## 4) How I Modified AI Suggestions Responsibly

- **Kept features lightweight:** Accepted only small, accessible JS enhancements—no tracking, no large libraries.
- **Matched my design system:** Adapted colors, spacing, and typography to the site’s existing tokens.
- **Accessibility & UX:**
  - Retained semantic HTML structure and descriptive alt text opportunities.
- **Reviewed and refactored:** Renamed classes or tweaked logic where needed, added small CSS for active nav, and avoided brittle selectors.
- **Crediting AI involvement:** Documented where AI contributed (descriptions, small JS, debugging tips) and where I made final decisions.

## 5) Summary

Using AI accelerated drafting, debugging, and small interactivity enhancements while I retained full control over design decisions and code quality. The result is a clearer, more polished portfolio with accessible, lightweight features and a better understanding of layout, CSS management, and practical debugging.
